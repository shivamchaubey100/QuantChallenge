# QuantChallenge Starter Repo

This is the starter repo to help you get started with QuantChallenge 2025.

## Sylvian Extension

Make sure you have installed the [Sylvian extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SylvianAI.sylvian) and initialized it. **This is required to be eligible for prizes!**
1. Go to the command palette (⇧⌘P on Mac, Ctrl + Shift + P otherwise)
2. Search for 'Sylvian: Initialize Sylvian'
3. Enter the email you used for the competition

If done correctly, your .competition file should include `email=your_email_here`. **DO NOT EDIT THIS .competition FILE**!

After having worked in your repository for a little, you should be able to go to quantchallenge.org > Dashboard > Settings and see that the extension is active. If it is not active, please contact support in the Discord!

## Directories

This repo consists of two folders: /research and /trading.

### 1. Research
The `research` folder contains a IPython notebook `research_starter.ipynb` that helps you get started on the datasets and how to format predictions for submission.

### 2. Trading
The `trading` folder contains both a C++ and Python template for trading algorithm to be used in the live trading portion of QuantChallenge 2025. For low-latency strategies, we recommend using C++ for a slight performance bump.

## Questions
If you have any lingering questions, reach out for support on Discord or email info@quantchallenge.org
